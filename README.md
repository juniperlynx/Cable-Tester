# Cable-Tester
This is a replacement PCB and software for a cheap commercial cable tester usually sold as the HL-486 (though there are other model numbers, mine is ST-M810).
It improves on the original design by adding beefier drive circuitry and a proper voltage regulator for the microcontroller.

Currently only the PCB for the master end of the tester is laid out though there are schematics for both ends.

You'll find the original Kicad design files in "Kicad Files/" and the software source code in "Software/".
If you'd like to build your own use the Gerber files in "Gerbers/" and a BOM in "BOM/"
