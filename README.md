# Cable-Tester
This is a replacement PCB and software for a cheap commercial cable tester usually sold as the HL-486 (though there are other model numbers, mine is ST-M810).
It improves on the original design by adding beefier drive circuitry and a proper voltage regulator for the microcontroller.

Schematics and PCB layouts are available for both ends. The Gerbers are currently untested though. The BOM also currently lacks part numbers and specs for the LED standoffs in the HL-486.

The original Kicad design files are in "Kicad Files/" and the software source code in "Software/".
If you'd like to build your own use the Gerber files in "Gerbers/" and the BOMs in "BOM/"
