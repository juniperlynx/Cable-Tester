# Cable-Tester
This is a replacement PCB and software for a cheap commercial cable tester usually sold as the HL-486 (though there are other model numbers, mine is ST-M810).
It improves on the original design by adding beefier drive circuitry and a proper voltage regulator for the microcontroller.

Currently I have only laid out the PCB for the master end of the tester though I do have schematics for both ends.

If you wish to build on this design you'll find the software source in Software and the design files in Kicad Files/Master and Kicad Files/Remote for the master and remote ends respectively.
You can also build your own or replace the PCB in your cable tester with the Gerbers in Gerbers/Master and the hex file Software/cabletester.hex.
Note that I do not have a complete BOM ready at this time.
